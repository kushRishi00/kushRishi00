This is the first ever project I made by myself. Probably known as a startup or a basic project. A calculator, (yeah a basic calculator). That is all I can do with the things I know about this language. But no regrets about making this.

a = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
b = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
#using define function for each operator.

    return (a+b)

    return (a-b)

    return (a*b)

    return (a**b)

    return math.sqrt(a)
def log(a, b=math.e):
    return math.log(a, b)
